<p>Lyte's Odyssey is a educational video game, developed in Unity Engine as part of my bachelor's degree dissertation. 
The game attempts to utilize well established learning theories to educate children in the concept of abstraction, problem analysis and solving.
While many of the mechanics are common in video games, in this particular project they are based on a solid body of research. The player controls a bunny that is tasked with saving the spirit tree, by traversing the land and reaching his goal.
 In his path he has to solve various puzzles, by utilizing both in-game and real life skill he acquires during the game. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Strong foundation in learning theory reasearch.
  </li>
  <li>
    Seamless merging of narrative and gameplay.
  </li>
  <li>
    Linear incremental difficulty and complexity of puzzles.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Endless RPG is a top down, hack & slash action rpg. Customize your hero in any way with a selection of 60 skills, including heavy melee attacks, fireballs, rain of arrows and so on. Gather randomly generated items, defeat large groups of enemies, battle unique bosses, discover and craft secret recipes and find all relic power ups.</p>
<p>This project was made in 2006-2007 and became very popular in the old YoYoGames website (GameMaker) with over 100 positive reviews, 10k+ downloads and a huge thread of comments and interaction with the player base. There where even some among the community that were inspired that attempted to develop clones of the game. Sadly, the old forums were taken down, and only few traces of its existence still remain.

<p>While this is by far my least effective work, and it was in a time before i had proper training and experience, it shows the passion and creativity i had for developing. A very amateur project i must admit, but none the less an important and influential to my personal growth as a developer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Great customization of playstyle with 60 skills and 9 item slots.
  </li>
  <li>
    Many secrets to discover, hidden areas, crafting recipes and game changing relics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Endless stress relieving grinding of enemy masses.
  </li>
</ul>

<a id="statement" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Footnote</h3>
<p>All art assets were created by myself, with more than 95% of it being original art and the remaining heavily edited existing images. While i am not a professional artist, i feel it is important to highlight this fact, because it suggests creativity, that i understand thematic cohesion and art direction as well as being able to communicate easily with the artists in a team.</p>
